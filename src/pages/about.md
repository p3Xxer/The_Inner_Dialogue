I'm a developer and occasional writer based on the internet. I spend most of my time building things with code, reading widely, and trying to think more clearly about the things that interest me.

This blog is called _The Inner Dialogue_ because that's what it is — a place to work through ideas in public. Not a newsletter, not a portfolio, just writing.

## What I write about

The posts here cover whatever I'm genuinely thinking about: tools and workflows, ideas from books I've been reading, things I've changed my mind about, and the occasional technical deep-dive. There's no strict theme. The through-line is that I only write about things I've had some direct experience with.

## Get in touch

The best way to reach me is by email: **hello@example.com**

I read everything but I'm slow to reply. If you're writing about something I've posted, I'm more likely to respond quickly.
